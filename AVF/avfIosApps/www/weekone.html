				<p><strong>Industry Research and Project</strong></p>
                
                <p><b>Less obvious perks of using 'live' data resources include logins and payments. How could Twitter be used in these two scenarios?</b></p>

				<p>I could see Twitter in both scenarios I mean we already see it in logins but payments would probably be possible but would the user want to use Twitter for such thing. I think a research on how user feel about it as a social media and a payment media would have to be made to determine. Would I personally use twitter as payments? No. I think a more secure interface would have to be implemented for such thing.</p>

				<p><b>Why would we need JSON-P, specifically?</b></p>

				<p>Researching on JSON-P, the concept of usage for JSON-P has been proven more affective since most web browsers prohibit such technic but yet able to request data from a server in a different domain and no complications or blockage to such data would by ideal for developers.</p>

				<p><b>Based on the JSON-P search results: what data resource(s) do you think might pair well with which types of Native device features?</b></p>

				<p>There are so many way to use JSON-P with native device features like getting info on the latest concert, the latest information on the news and the list would go on and on because of all the mashups that can be made to obtain such data for usage.</p>

				<p><b>Please describe any design and functionality intentions you may have for your Demo app components this month.</b></p>

				<p>I believe use the components picked to search on maps, see whatâ€™s trending on twitter and Facebook, continue to save contacts and data in order to use on a later day is very important. Twitter and Facebook have shown to be affective when natural disasters have occurred. The data from such twitter trends have help to locate the major needs in areas affected by natural disasters.</p>

				<p><b>Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, development, etc.</b></p>

				<p>Our previous MIU class was very helpful in how a design concept should be noted when doing such for mobile. The feel, wording and structure on how to design and develop for mobile were very effective for me. Also the knowledge of coding such design and implementing the usage and how a user can interact with interfaces was a great learning tool.</p>
